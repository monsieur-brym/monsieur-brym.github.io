        <h2>THE MAN BEHIND THE DM SCREEN</h2>
        <p>I am a 21 year old Data Analytics undergrad at Arizona State University. I have always loved fiction, fantasy, and anthropology. For me, Dungeons and Dragons has been a way for me to talk and think about what I love, while getting closer with my little brothers and friends.</p>
        <p>This is a common story for people who play D&D. It starts as something silly, but grows to become so much more!</p>

        <h3>MEET THE PARTY</h3>
        <p>These are my little brothers as we play Dungeons & Dragons. In front of them are their character sheets and dice. That is how they play their characters, by utilizing stat sheets and random roles. Behind my Dungeon Master screen are maps, notes, and dice to build the world around them.</p>
